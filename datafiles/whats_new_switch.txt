Welcome to Sticky Paws on Nintendo Switch!

First release of Sticky Paws on this platform!

This is a cute momentum-based platformer, where you jump and pounce, and explore colorful levels at your own pace. You can either play casually, or challenge yourself to get really good at the movement and speed

This version is built specifically for console play, with controller-focused controls and a smooth handheld experience

Thank you for giving Sticky Paws a chance.
I hope it brings you joy
