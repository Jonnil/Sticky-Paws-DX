Hey! More polish, more stability, more quality-of-life improvements across the game!

I've cleaned up menus, improved background systems, and made sure things feel smoother and more reliable overall. Some changes are subtle, but they help make Sticky Paws a nicer experience to return to

Thank you so much for playing Sticky Paws and supporting my work.
It genuinely means the world to me
