/* Returns a value that will scr_wave back and forth between [from-to] over [duration] seconds
		Examples
		image_angle = scr_wave(-45, 45, 1, 0)  -> rock back and forth 90 degrees in a second
		x = scr_wave(- 10, 10, 0.25, 0)         -> move left and right quickly

		Or here is a fun one! Make an object be all squishy!! ^u^
		image_xscale = scr_wave(0.5, 2.0, 1.0, 0.0)
		image_yscale = scr_wave(2.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0) */
